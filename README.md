# ShortestPath
Program which implements Dijkstra's algorithm, to calculate the shortest route between major UK cities, and displays the entire path and total distance. 


Program reads the file "ukcities.txt" in a tab-delimited format and stores all the data inside an array of a data structure called 
'intertown_distance'. A secondary text file "citypairs.txt", which will contain the routes the program calculates. E.g, in the text file it contains
a line 'Leicester Moffat'. The program will then run the Dijkstra's algorithm and calculate the shortest distance between Leicester
and Moffat. The entire journey and total distance will then be wrote to the 'paths.txt' text file.


Open the FebruaryAssignment.cbp project file, then compile main.c to run the program.
